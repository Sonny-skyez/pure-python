Hi guys!

I'm storing here a few of my simple projects in Python 3.7,
some of them should interest you, i hope! Feel free 
to make some suggestions or to ask any questions :)

1. [calculator](https://github.com/Sonny-skyez/pure-python/blob/master/1-calculator.py) - my first project ever, made to practice some object oriented programming and usage of python functions. A simple program made in some interesting way. Check it out!

2. [palindromes](https://github.com/Sonny-skyez/pure-python/blob/master/2-palindromes.py) - second project, i have learned how to properly use textwrap library;still not sure if i should use time.sleep() in this script, feel free to comment!

3. [prime numbers](https://github.com/Sonny-skyez/pure-python/blob/master/3-prime%20numbers.py) - third project, i have spent some time to figure out, which algorithm to generate prime numbers is the simpliest one. I think this solution is interesting, take a look, some feedback will be nice to hear :)
